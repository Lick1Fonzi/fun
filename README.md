# fun
Created in 2021, during my first year as computer science student

This repo is intended to be a collection of little projects/exercises i made for fun and to broaden my knowledge.
I wanted to share these codes not because they are well-written (as i said these are experiments to learn how to code by myself) but because it motivates and inspires me seeing projects from friends and other people and i hope someone can find a bit of inspiration in here.

Projects:
- 2048.cpp : command line replica of famous 2048 game in c/c++
- langton_ant.nlogo : langton ant implemented using Netlogo 
- forza4 : 4 in a row gametable (vertical tictactoe, "forza 4" in italian) using pygame and python 3.8.2. Started in oop style but failed.
- routegame.cpp : try to complete the puzzle  by making the "snake" go through every point of the grid without passing on the same point and avoiding the obstacles. Searching for an algorithm that finds if there is a solution and what it is.
- nregine.cpp : program that finds all solutions to the n queen problem using backtracking in c++. Default value of N variable (that sets an NxN chessboard) is 8 but can be changed within the source code. Note that for 1<N<4 there are no solutions.
